# OpenCraft
As you might've guessed it is an open-source version of minecraft. 
The idea behind this project is to give developers the ability to mod the clone of minecraft, as they wish, with no copyrigt whatsoever. 
We believe this would give lot's of developers an ability to base their wonderful games on minecraft's mechanics, unfortunately minecraft is not only owned by Microsoft, which means it is propriatary but horribly optimised and designed as well, since mojang from the beginning didn't really care about the code architecture, and only added, not always needed, features which bloats down such disasterous code even further, only the fact that minecraft by default takes only couple of cores to run - speaks for itself.
